Objectives:

Implement a model of an enterprise-level network using a simulation tool.
Create a machine learning anomaly detection model by utilizing the concepts of GNN and Transformer in enterprise-level networks.
Collect network traffic data to train the model.
Use the anomaly detection model to analyze the behavior of the network.
